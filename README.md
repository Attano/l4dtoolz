l4dtoolz
========

This extension allows server admins to increase slots up to 32. Unlike left4downtown, which only offers up to 18 slots.
It has been tweaked to reduce the number of redundant cvars and to mantain full compatibility with confogl configs, by using the old l4d_maxplayers cvar instead of sv_maxplayers.
